# AI Smart Contract Generator

A full-stack application that leverages OpenAI's Assistant API to automatically generate smart contracts based on user requirements. The system uses Firebase Cloud Functions for the backend and React for the frontend, with real-time updates through Pusher.

## Overview

This project aims to automate the creation of smart contracts by using AI to:
- Design the contract architecture
- Generate source code
- Create test files
- Produce documentation

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built using Firebase Cloud Functions and implements the following key features:

### Core Components

- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses OpenAI's Assistant API with multiple specialized assistants:
  - Designer Assistant 
  - Builder Assistant 
  - Test Builder Assistant 
  - Documentation Assistant 

- **Real-time Updates**: Uses Pusher for real-time communication between backend and frontend
- **Firebase Firestore**: Stores generated contracts and analytics data

### Key Features

1. **Chat Handler**: Manages conversation threads with the AI assistants
2. **Contract Generation Pipeline**:
   - Design phase with Designer Assistant
   - Code generation with Builder Assistant
   - Test generation with Test Builder Assistant
   - Documentation generation
3. **Real-time Progress Updates**: Streams generation progress to frontend
4. **Analytics Tracking**: Monitors contract generation metrics

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:

bash
cd backend/functions
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Configure environment variables:
   - OpenAI API Key
   - Firebase credentials
   - Pusher credentials

3. Deploy Firebase functions:

bash
firebase deploy --only functions

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

bash
cd frontend/my-app
npm install


2. Configure environment variables in `.env`:

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG=...
REACT_APP_PUSHER_KEY=...
REACT_APP_PUSHER_CLUSTER=...


3. Start development server:

bash
npm start

## Usage

1. Navigate to the application in your browser
2. Enter your smart contract requirements in natural language
3. Watch real-time progress as the AI:
   - Designs the contract architecture
   - Generates the contract code
   - Creates comprehensive tests
   - Produces documentation

## Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Describe your smart contract requirements in plain English
- **Multi-Stage Generation**: Automated pipeline for design, implementation, testing, and documentation
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates during the generation process
- **Contract Validation**: Automated security checks and best practices verification
- **Export Options**: Download generated contracts in multiple formats

## Security Considerations

- All generated contracts should undergo thorough security audits before deployment
- The system implements rate limiting and input validation
- API keys and sensitive credentials are properly secured
- Regular security updates and dependency maintenance
